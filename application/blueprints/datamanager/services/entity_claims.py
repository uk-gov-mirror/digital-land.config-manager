"""
Entity-number claim registry.

Add-data assigns entity numbers per collection at assessment time and freezes them
into the request result, but they are not visible on the config branch until the
GitHub Action commits ~1-2 minutes later. During that window a concurrent
same-collection submission is assessed against the same HEAD and gets the *same*
numbers, and the confirm-time branch compare can't see a not-yet-committed conflict.

This registry records the numbers a confirm is about to commit, scoped to the target
branch, so a second confirm that would overlap is caught immediately - with no
dependence on the (laggy) GitHub Actions API. Entries expire after a TTL that only has
to bridge assessment->commit; the branch compare takes over once the commit lands.
